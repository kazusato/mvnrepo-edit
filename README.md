# mvnrepo-edit

[MVN Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) generates Gradle dependency snippets but a little bit old style
like using "compile" or "testCompile" scopes.

This tool edits the snippets and generates in a newer style.

Run the tool as shown below and put the old-styled snippets in the left textarea.
Then you can see a newer snippets in the right textarea.

You can change the usage of single or double quotes and parentheses with switches.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project

```
